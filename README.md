# Linux-Final-Project.
A simple script couting from 1 to 50, along with notes and the general process to upload to git hub. 

Notes/Process:
1. Made a Github repository, named it "Linux Final Project"
2. Did research on shell bash scripting, got some refereshers/learned something new. Figured out the "while" command. 
3. Began trial and error on the script, found out I organized it wrong which caused an error
4. reevaluated life choices
5. Fixed script, now it counts from 1 to 50!
6. Decided to have a little fun with the "echo" command
7. The Count reference
8. Im hilarious!
9. After finishing, made it executable with "chmod u+x linuxfinalproject.sh"
10. Took respective screenshots, made "Linux Project Screenshots" folder
11. Established Connection to Github, realized I shouldve put the script in after I made the connection
12. Copy script into Git repository, commited it via command line
13. updated README
14. Some excruciating technical difficulties ensued, Many of which made me feel stupid 
Had to use an access key for authentication, then use "git pull" and "git merge" to obtain and update the changes to README.md
After authenticating then updating, used "git push origin main" to upload the script to github.com.
Began quality inspection
