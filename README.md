A simple script couting from 1 to 50. 

Notes/Process:
1. Made a Github repository, named it "Linux Final Project"
2. Did research on shell bash scripting, got some refereshers/learned something new. Figured out the "while" command. 
3. Began trial and error on the script, found out I organized it wrong which caused a syntax error
4. reevaluated life choices
5. Fixed script, now it counts from 1 to 50!
6. Decided to have a little fun with the "echo" command
7. The Count reference
8. Im hilarious!
